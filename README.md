An educational tool for demonstrating and comparing disk scheduling algorithms used in operating systems.

## Features

- **Six Algorithms Implemented**:
  - FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
  - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
  - SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
  - C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
  - LOOK
  - C-LOOK

- **Interactive GUI**:
  - Visualize head movement sequences
  - Compare total head movement across algorithms
  - Configurable disk parameters
  - Load requests from files

- **Educational Focus**:
  - Algorithm descriptions
  - Performance metrics
  - Visual representation of scheduling patterns
